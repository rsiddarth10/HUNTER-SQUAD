Meetings are necessary — but often inefficient. In this hackathon, your challenge is to build an AI Agent that revolutionizes how teams digest and act on meeting conversations.

Using generative AI and LLMs, your bot will take raw transcripts (from Zoom, Google Meet, MS Teams, etc.) and instantly output:

Lightning-fast, human-like summaries

Action items with deadlines and assignees

Clean, shareable formats for Slack, email, Notion, or docs

Whether it’s a daily standup or a cross-functional strategy call, your bot should intelligently identify key decisions, follow-ups, and tasks, helping remote and fast-paced teams get aligned — without the chaos of manual note-taking.

Impact:
Empower modern teams to:

Cut through the noise in meetings

Always leave with clarity

Stay accountable to action items
A tool like this is a must-have agent for GenAI-powered workplaces, especially in remote/hybrid environments.

Agentic Features to Consider:
LLM-based summarization and task extraction

Smart context awareness (speaker tags, tone, importance)

Deadline inference from context ("by Friday", "before next call")

Ownership detection (“Let’s have John lead this”)

Output integration: export to tools like Slack, Trello, Notion, or email

Tech Stack Ideas:
Frontend: React.js or Next.js

Backend: Node.js / Python (FastAPI)

LLMs: OpenAI GPT-4 / Claude / Gemini / open-source models (LLama2, Mistral)

Transcription APIs: AssemblyAI, Whisper, Deepgram

Task Management APIs: Notion, Trello, Asana

Optional: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to pull meeting context from past notes or docs
